        <p class="opening">Happy Anniversary Dear,</p>
        <p class="isi">Hopefully we will remain strong and patient in this relationship. I'm sorry because my current condition is not good, which makes us very far apart. What is certain is that I promise to remain loyal and love you until I die. Maybe not this year, not next year, not the next few years, but I will definitely try to make you happy and marry you. Sorry, I can only give this on our anniversary this year.</p>
        <p class="love">I LOVE YOU</p>
